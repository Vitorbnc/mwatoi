Detailed Instructions

Thanks to everybody in this post, I finally made it in life, well, I mean... I managed to de-crypt the WA database as of today (29/02/2020, so it still works yey!!) after just a few hours of "playing" (not a funny game tho).
Because I'm quite bored this morning, I feel the need to give a thorough list of instructions for the newcomers (a kind summary because many have already been given in this post):

First, the "foreplay" steps, if you know what I mean ;) :

    Enable "USB Debugging" in your phone
    Verify you have the latest version of Java and the Android Debug Bridge Drivers in your PC
    Download the .zip from this post
    Extract it without changing the overall structure of the folder
    Download WA 2.11.431 (like from android-apk.org)
    Put it in the tmp folder replacing LegacyWhatsApp.apk


Second, the feel like a hacker from Mr. Robot steps:

    Launch WhatsAppKeyDBExtract.bat file
    Input Y to reboot the device
    Once rebooted, unlock it (you should not find your WA app anymore) and press any key in CW
    Wait until the streamed install is done
    Unlock again your phone
    Prompted "WA has been updated" should be prompted in your phone, press continue
    Search for WA in your phone and open it
    (A new prompt in your phone will say it's an outdated version of WA press ok, if it doesnt appear don't worry)
    Press the adjust date and you will be sent to a Date & Time page, keep it open
    Press any key in CW
    Select the option you prefer at the command window
    Select fullback up in your phone (without entering any password)
    Restore WA press any key
    You MADE IT as well :highfive:


Finally you should download the Whatsapp Viewer and use it to open the msgstor.db file
I hope it helps and sorry for the bad jokes :p

WA = Whatsapp
CW = Command Window
